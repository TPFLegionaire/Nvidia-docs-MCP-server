# Security Guidelines for Nvidia-docs-MCP-server

This document provides comprehensive security recommendations for the **Nvidia-docs-MCP-server** project. It aligns with industry best practices for secure design, implementation, and deployment. All guidelines below must be adopted and enforced throughout development and operations.

---

## 1. Security by Design & Secure Defaults

• **Embed security from day one**: Integrate threat modeling, security requirements, and design reviews before writing code.  
• **Secure defaults**: Configure all libraries, servers, and components with the most restrictive settings out-of-the-box.  
• **Least privilege**: Grant services, processes, and database accounts only the minimum permissions required.  
• **Defense in depth**: Layer controls (network policies, firewall rules, authentication, input validation, logging) so that compromise of one control does not yield full access.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

• **Strong authentication**:  
  – Use HTTPS-only login endpoints.  
  – Hash stored passwords with Argon2 or bcrypt using per-user unique salts.  
• **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:  
  – Choose a strong algorithm (e.g., HS256 or RS256), never allow `none`.  
  – Validate `exp`, `iss`, and `aud` claims on every request.  
  – Sign and store secrets in a secure vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).  
• **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  – Define at least two roles: `reader` for documentation access and `writer` (or `mcp_client`) for MCP messaging.  
  – Enforce authorization checks on every endpoint and RPC method.  
• **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  
  – Plan for MFA integration (e.g., TOTP) for administrative access or future user self-service features.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

• **Server-side validation**:  
  – Use Pydantic schemas (FastAPI) or gRPC Protobuf validation to strictly enforce input types, lengths, and formats.  
  – Reject unexpected fields and enforce strict JSON parsing.  
• **Prevent injection**:  
  – Use parameterized queries or ORM methods for any database interactions (if added later).  
  – Sanitize file paths before reading from the `docs/` directory to prevent directory traversal.  
• **Output encoding**:  
  – Escape or encode any user-supplied data before including it in logs or HTTP responses to prevent XSS.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

• **Transport encryption**:  
  – Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all HTTP and gRPC traffic.  
  – Redirect HTTP→HTTPS at the load balancer.  
• **At-rest encryption**:  
  – If persistent storage is added (e.g., message queues, databases), enable AES-256 encryption.  
• **Secret management**:  
  – Do not hard-code secrets in code or config.  
  – Use environment variables and/or a secrets management service for JWT keys, database credentials.  
• **PII handling**:  
  – Minimize logging of user identifiers.  
  – Mask or redact sensitive data in logs and error messages.

## 5. API & Service Security

• **Rate limiting & throttling**:  
  – Implement request rate limits per IP or per token (e.g., 100 req/min) using middleware.  
• **CORS policy**:  
  – Allow only trusted origins for browser-based Swagger UI consumption.  
  – Deny all other cross-origin requests by default.  
• **API versioning**:  
  – Keep `/v1/` prefixes for REST endpoints and maintain backward compatibility for gRPC services.  
• **Proper HTTP methods**:  
  – Use POST for operations that change state (`/mcp/send`) and GET for safe, idempotent calls (`/docs/*`, `/health`).

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

• **CSRF protection**:  
  – For any future web forms (if introduced), use anti-CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies.  
• **Security headers**:  
  – `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`  
  – `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`  
  – `X-Frame-Options: DENY`  
  – `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`  
  – `Content-Security-Policy` restricting resources to self-hosted origins.  
• **Secure cookies**:  
  – Set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes on any session or auth cookies.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

• **Harden server configurations**:  
  – Disable unnecessary OS services and open ports.  
  – Keep container images minimal (e.g., use `python:3.9-slim`).  
• **TLS configuration**:  
  – Use strong cipher suites (e.g., ECDHE_RSA with AES_128_GCM).  
  – Disable TLS 1.0/1.1.  
• **Configuration as code**:  
  – Store `config.yml` and deployment manifests in Git with access control.  
  – Validate config syntax on CI.  
• **Disable debug in production**:  
  – Ensure FastAPI’s `debug=False` and no interactive consoles are exposed.

## 8. Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response

• **Structured logging**:  
  – Use JSON format and include correlation IDs for tracing through distributed requests.  
• **Access and audit logs**:  
  – Log all authentication attempts, policy failures, and admin configuration changes.  
• **Metrics & alerting**:  
  – Expose Prometheus metrics and set alerts for error rates, high latency, or resource exhaustion.  
• **Error handling**:  
  – Return generic error messages to clients.  
  – Log full stack traces only internally.

## 9. Dependency & Supply-Chain Security

• **Use lockfiles**:  
  – Commit `requirements.txt` and/or `Pipfile.lock` to pin exact versions.  
• **Vulnerability scanning**:  
  – Integrate SCA tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) into CI to detect insecure dependencies.  
• **Minimal footprint**:  
  – Only include required packages.  
  – Regularly prune unused dependencies.

## 10. CI/CD & Release Management

• **Secure pipelines**:  
  – Restrict build credentials to least-privileged roles.  
  – Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.  
• **Peer reviews & gating**:  
  – Enforce mandatory code reviews and security sign-off on pull requests.  
• **Automated tests**:  
  – Include security checks (e.g., linting for injection patterns, unit tests for auth logic).

**Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory.** Security controls should be validated in code reviews and periodic threat assessments. Flag any uncertainties for security-team review before merging changes into production branches.
