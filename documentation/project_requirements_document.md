# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The **Nvidia-docs-MCP-server** is a backend service designed to solve two main challenges in high-performance computing ecosystems: (1) enabling reliable multi-process communication (MCP) and (2) serving Nvidia-related documentation through a unified interface. Many complex applications need both fast, asynchronous message exchange between processes and easy access to up-to-date guides, API references, and tutorials. This server consolidates those needs into a single, extensible platform.

We’re building this project to streamline development workflows around Nvidia products and GPU-accelerated applications. By handling process registration, message routing, and document delivery in one place, teams can reduce boilerplate code, eliminate ad-hoc doc-hosting solutions, and focus on their core algorithms. Success means stable inter-process communications, sub-100 ms average response time for message round-trips, and sub-50 ms page loads for documentation under typical load.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (Version 1.0)**
- Core MCP engine to register clients and route messages (via REST and gRPC).
- Static documentation hosting (Markdown or HTML) served over HTTP(S).
- Configuration management via environment variables and YAML files.
- Basic authentication and authorization (JWT tokens) for both MCP and doc endpoints.
- Logging of requests, errors, and authentication events.
- Health check and basic metrics endpoint (`/health`, `/metrics`).

**Out-of-Scope (Future Phases)**
- Dynamic docs generation pipelines (e.g., live Sphinx/MkDocs builds).
- Custom binary or peer-to-peer MCP protocols beyond REST/gRPC.
- Advanced GPU telemetry integration or Nvidia SDK hooks.
- Web-based administration UI.
- Built-in load balancing or service mesh (e.g., Istio).
- Multi-tenant isolation beyond token scopes.

## 3. User Flow

A developer or system administrator starts by deploying the MCP server (e.g., with Docker Compose or Kubernetes). They supply a `.yaml` config or environment variables for ports, doc repository path, auth secret, and protocol settings. Once the server is running, they test the `/health` endpoint and verify that Swagger (OpenAPI) docs are available at `/docs`.

Next, a client process (written in Python, Go, or C++) authenticates via the `/login` endpoint, receives a JWT, and calls `/mcp/register` to join a communication group. The client sends and receives messages through `/mcp/send` and `/mcp/receive` (REST) or equivalent gRPC methods. Separately, a user in a browser navigates to `/docs/index.html` or queries `/docs/versioned-api.yaml` to fetch documentation instantly. All interactions follow the JWT-secured, encrypted channels specified.

## 4. Core Features

- **Multi-Process Communication (MCP) Engine**  
  • Client registration and heartbeat tracking  
  • Message queuing, routing, and acknowledgements  
  • REST API endpoints and gRPC service definitions
- **Documentation Hosting**  
  • Serves static HTML/Markdown from a configurable folder  
  • Versioned doc paths (e.g., `/v1.0/`, `/latest/`)  
  • Content-type headers and caching policies
- **Configuration Management**  
  • Environment variables and `config.yml` support  
  • Dynamic reload on config changes (optional flag)
- **Security & Access Control**  
  • JWT-based authentication  
  • Role-based authorization (reader vs. writer)  
  • HTTPS enforcement (TLS termination)
- **Observability**  
  • Structured logging (JSON format)  
  • Metrics endpoint exporting Prometheus-style counters  
  • Health check endpoint

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Backend Language & Framework**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI (async HTTP)  
- **gRPC Support**: `grpcio`, Protobuf definitions under `proto/`  
- **Web Server**: Uvicorn or Hypercorn (ASGI)  
- **Configuration**: PyYAML for `config.yml`, `python-dotenv` for environment variables  
- **Auth & Security**: `PyJWT` for tokens, built-in FastAPI security utilities  
- **Logging**: `structlog` or standard `logging` with JSON output  
- **Metrics**: `prometheus-client` library  
- **Documentation**: Static files in `docs/`, served via FastAPI’s StaticFiles  
- **Testing**: pytest with `httpx` for HTTP, `grpctest` for gRPC  
- **IDE & Plugins**: VS Code with Pylance, Black, Flake8, and mkdocs plugins (optional)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: 1000 concurrent clients, <100 ms round-trip for MCP, <50 ms doc file serving under 50 MB/s network.
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous I/O, worker pooling, and ability to horizontally scale behind a load balancer.
- **Security**: TLS encryption required; JWT with 15 min expiry; input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA; graceful shutdown on SIGTERM; retry logic for dropped connections.
- **Usability**: OpenAPI (Swagger) UI available; clear error codes and messages (4xx/5xx).

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Python 3.9+ Environment**: Deployment targets must support Python 3.9 or later.
- **Persistent Storage**: Documentation lives on a shared file system or volume mount.
- **Network**: Ports 80/443 (docs), 8000 (MCP/REST), 50051 (gRPC) must be open.
- **Token Secrets**: A stable, secure JWT secret or key pair is provisioned externally.
- **No GPU Dependencies**: Version 1 does not require direct Nvidia SDKs or GPU drivers.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **gRPC in Browser**: Browsers don’t natively support gRPC; consider gRPC-Web or fallback to REST.
- **API Rate Limits**: Without built-in throttling, clients could overwhelm the server; mitigate by adding a rate-limit middleware.
- **Config Reload Race**: Dynamic config reload can create inconsistent state; require manual restart if in doubt.
- **Large Doc Files**: Very large markdown or HTML files may block event loop; ensure static file serving uses efficient file streaming.
- **Token Revocation**: JWTs are stateless; revoking tokens early requires a central blacklist or short expiry times.
